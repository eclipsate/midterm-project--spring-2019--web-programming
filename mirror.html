   <p>Allow your camera to have access so you take a look at yourself in the mirror. Using p5.js, I created a skectch that will invert your webcam image and follow along with your mouse. This symbolizes how your face and physical appearance always follows you - if you're born a male but identify as a female, just looking in the mirror and knowing how others view you can be a very hard thing to deal with. Press any key to end the sketch and have control of your mouse again.</p>
