            <p>Putting labels on your sexuality is a very constraining and daunting task for most people - especially young people who are still figuring themselves out. Even if you've always thought of yourself as hetrosexual, you may find that when you sit down and think about it, you're not sure which sex you're attracted to and why. The interactive piece on the left was created in p5.js and aims to portray the suffocating feeling that defining your gender or sexuality can cause for some people.
